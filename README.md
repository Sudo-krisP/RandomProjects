Assorted projects I do in my free time.

MathParadox_Tester:
  MathParadox_Tester is a single file application I developed using python.  Its purpose is to test the paradoxical, mathematical problem where ANY integer will end in a 4-2-1 loop
  given the following rules:  If the number is even, divide by 2, and if the number is odd, multiply by 3 and add 1 to the product.  This is, by nature, a recursive function so that
  is the approach I took.
