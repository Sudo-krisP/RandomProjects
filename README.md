# RandomProjects
Assorted projects I do in my free time.

FlappyBird:
  I created this to help me learn Java.  I mostly followed a tutorial as it was my first attempt at using jframes and graphical interfaces.  I also used this project to learn how to
  compile a .jar of the program to execute without running through IntelliJ, although you do need java to make it work.  Overall its a pretty basic application but I learned a lot from it.

MathParadox_Tester:
  MathParadox_Tester is a single file application I developed using python.  Its purpose is to test the paradoxical, mathematical problem where ANY integer will end in a 4-2-1 loop
  given the following rules:  If the number is even, divide by 2, and if the number is odd, multiply by 3 and add 1 to the product.  This is, by nature, a recursive function so that
  is the approach I took.
